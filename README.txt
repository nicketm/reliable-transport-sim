Part 1:
- used following link for cutting bytes:

Part 2:
- used following link for figuring out size and components of TCP header:
https://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/tcp_header.shtml

Part 5:
- As you can see through our code, we spent a lot of time in the last 2 days trying to figure out part 5,
but we didn't end up figuring out the whole thing. We didn't want to jeopordize losing points on the other sections,
so we commented it out. We hope you can consider our code for some partial credit. Thanks!
